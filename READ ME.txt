1\. Exploratory Analysis  

Basic checks to understand store distribution:



| Store Location | Total Orders |

|----------------|--------------|

| Calgary | 936 |

| Montreal | 990 |

| Ottawa | 1094 |

| Toronto | 997 |

| Vancouver | 983 |



Insight:

Order distribution is balanced across stores, with Ottawa slightly leading. This indicates consistent customer activity across regions.

| 2025‑11 | 122,285 |

| 2025‑12 | 126,745 |

| 2026‑01 | 735 |



Key Observations

\- \*\*December\*\* consistently peaks (holiday season effect).  

\- \*\*January\*\* also shows strong performance, likely post‑holiday tech purchases.  

\- \*\*Mid‑year months (Jun–Aug)\*\* show slight dips, indicating seasonal slowdown.  

\- \*\*2026‑01\*\* is low because the dataset ends early in the year.

3\. High‑Value Customers  

Top customers by total spending:



| Customer ID | Name | Total Spent | Orders |

|-------------|------|-------------|--------|

| 672 | Sophia Brown | 4,950 | 2 |

| 1775 | Daniel Johnson | 3,450 | 2 |

| 19 | Sarah Taylor | 3,400 | 1 |

| 20 | Emma Brown | 3,400 | 1 |

| 22 | Linda Wilson | 3,400 | 1 |

| 66 | Sophia Davis | 3,400 | 1 |

| 75 | Emma Taylor | 3,400 | 1 |

| 75 | John Taylor | 3,400 | 1 |

| 90 | Emma Smith | 3,400 | 1 |

| 105 | Sarah Miller | 3,400 | 1 |



\### Insight

A small number of customers contribute disproportionately to revenue.  

This supports targeted retention strategies such as loyalty programs or personalized offers.

\## 🏬 4. Store Performance (Average Order Value)



| Store Location | Avg Order Value |

|----------------|-----------------|

| Calgary | 667.60 |

| Montreal | 694.41 |

| Ottawa | 631.91 |

| Toronto | 631.73 |

| Vancouver | 650.79 |



\### Insight

\- \*\*Montreal\*\* leads in average order value — customers spend more per transaction.  

\- \*\*Ottawa and Toronto\*\* have lower AOV, suggesting more frequent but smaller purchases.  

\- \*\*Calgary and Vancouver\*\* sit in the mid‑range.



\---



\## 🧠 5. Business Insights Summary



\### Seasonality

\- Strong peaks in \*\*December\*\* and \*\*January\*\*.  

\- Mid‑year slowdown suggests opportunities for promotions during summer months.



\### Customer Value

\- High‑value customers are identifiable and few — ideal for VIP programs.  

\- Many customers make only one high‑value purchase, indicating potential for re‑engagement campaigns.



\### Store Strategy

\- Montreal’s higher AOV suggests successful upselling or premium product interest.  

\- Ottawa’s high order count but lower AOV suggests volume‑based strategies.
